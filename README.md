## What is Suika2?

Suika2 is a development suite for Visual Novels.
It has an open-source philosophy and is designed with a true cross-platform portablity including iOS and Android.
It is equipped with features and tools of production-grade quality.
Suika2 is perfect for both beginners and seasoned creators alike.

Effortlessness and efficiently are key concepts of Suika2.
It provides that without sacrificing features or usability to enrich both the creator and user experience.

We don't aim for no-code but we achieve low-code using multiple DSLs, Domain Specific Languages.
Specifically, there are separate languages for scenarios, GUI, and logic.
We are in the process of adding a little graphical support for each DSL.
This is quite different from other engines and we call it "Visual Live Scripting" technology.
The author thinks as a researcher of software engineering that VLS is one shape of RAD, Rapid Application Development.

## What is the Suika2's Development Goal?

**"The New Standard for Visual Novel Creation"**, in the era of 2020s and beyond, is the goal of the Suika2 development.

## Documentation

* [Japanese Documentation](https://suika2.com/wiki/?%E3%83%89%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A5%E3%83%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88)

## Portability

Games made with Suika2 can run on Windows PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android phone/tablet, Web browser, Chromebook, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and some consoles.

Suika2 consists of a platform independent core (CORE) and a hardware abstraction layer (HAL).
The CORE is written in ANSI C, the most portable programming language in the world, while HAL implementations are currently written in C, C++, Objective-C, and Java.

If you would like to port Suika2 to a new target platform, you only need to write a thin HAL, this is generally possible within a week.

Suika2 does not depend on SDKs or frameworks such as Unity, Godot, Python, or SDL2, this is thanks to the extensive design of HAL, our compatibility layer's API.

## CI/CD Pipiline

* We do CI for build sanity checks on every push to the repository using GitHub Actions.
* We currently don't have a way to do CD on the cloud due to a lack of code signing capability.
* However, the author has a release script and thus releases are fully automated on his MacBook Pro.
